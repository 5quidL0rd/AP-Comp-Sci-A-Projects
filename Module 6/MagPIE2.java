/**
 * A program to carry on conversations with a human user.
 * This is the initial version that:
 *     - Uses indexOf to find strings
 *     - Handles responding to simple words and phrases
 * This version uses a nested if to handle default responses.
 *
 * Code adapted from work by Laurie White for the College Board.
 *
 *
 * This code has been altered to use the keyword in the getResponse method to 
 * create more tailored, specific responses. Additionally, more keywords were added
 * and MagPie has been given additional non-commital responses to rotate through.
